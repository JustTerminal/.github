Rules for collaborating

    Only write in English
    Must Sign off
    Fork the project directory
        Update you local deploy branch alway
        before any new development
        Then update you current working branch, as well (to avoid conflicts)
    Branch creating:
        Base the branch off the 'deploy'
        Naming should always be: feature/[date -> yyyy.mm.dd].[your-user-name]
        Bugfixes should always be named: bugfix/[date -> yyyy.mm.dd].[your-user-name]
    PRs must be informative: [Directory Name]: [Feature you are working on]
    Use only one of the terminal libraries mentioned above per project to interact with terminal and create the software
    Versioning must be based on PEP 440
    Linting/Code refactoring: Black is a must!
    Packaging

Rules for publishing to pypi (Python specific)

    Code must have passed the CR
    Code must have been formatted by Black
    Publishing must be done with Twine

Overall Software Requirement(s)

    Must be terminal interactive

Disambiguation

    Not every single project has to be published to pypi
    You are allowed to use other languages that help you get the best out of Python, propelling it and such,
    HOWEVER, it's pivotal that the terminal interaction/core language be one of the suggested ones.
    Make sure all the projects have a (open-source type) license
